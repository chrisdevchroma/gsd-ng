<purpose>
Validate `.planning/` directory integrity and report actionable issues. Checks for missing files, invalid configurations, inconsistent state, and orphaned plans. Optionally repairs auto-fixable issues.

Read all files referenced by the invoking prompt's execution_context before starting.

<step name="parse_args">
**Parse arguments:**

Check if `--repair` flag is present in the command arguments.

```
REPAIR_FLAG=""
if arguments contain "--repair"; then
  REPAIR_FLAG="--repair"
fi
```
</step>

<step name="run_health_check">
**Run health validation:**

```bash
node "$HOME/.claude/gsd-ng/bin/gsd-tools.cjs" validate health $REPAIR_FLAG
```

Parse JSON output:
- `status`: "healthy" | "degraded" | "broken"
- `errors[]`: Critical issues (code, message, fix, repairable)
- `warnings[]`: Non-critical issues
- `info[]`: Informational notes
- `nyquist`: The standing compliance signal — see below
- `repairable_count`: Number of auto-fixable issues
- `repairs_performed[]`: Actions taken if --repair was used

The `nyquist` object is a census of every `*-VALIDATION.md` in `.planning/phases/`, reported
whether or not any of W009/W026/W027 fired:

| Key | Meaning |
|-----|---------|
| `total` | VALIDATION.md files found |
| `compliant` | `nyquist_compliant: true` **and** a `## Validation Audit` section |
| `forged` | promoted with no audit trail — the same files W027 reports as errors |
| `held` | not promoted: validated with gaps, or never validated |
| `manual_only_count` | carve-outs summed across the compliant phases |
| `evidence_tiers` | `tier_a` / `tier_m` / `manual` rows, summed across the compliant phases |
| `tiers_declared_by` | how many compliant phases declared a tier split at all |

`compliant + forged + held == total`. A forgery is counted on its own rather than folded into
either neighbour: it is not evidence of compliance and it is not an honest hold.

`tiers_declared_by` qualifies the split. `evidence_tiers` sums the `evidence_tiers` frontmatter
field, which postdates any phase promoted before it existed, so a compliant phase that declares
nothing contributes zero and the split is a floor rather than a census.

**Format and display results:**

```
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
 GSD Health Check
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

Status: HEALTHY | DEGRADED | BROKEN
Errors: N | Warnings: N | Info: N
Nyquist: N/M phases compliant (K held, F forged) — evidence A TIER-A / B TIER-M, C manual-only, declared by D of N
```

Always print the Nyquist line, including when it reads `0/M`. The gate decayed from a genuine
7-of-7 to an effective 7-of-83 because nothing ever reported the ratio; a signal shown only when
it looks interesting is the same silence with extra steps.

**If repairs were performed:**
```
## Repairs Performed

- ✓ config.json: Created with defaults
- ✓ STATE.md: Regenerated from roadmap
```

**If errors exist:**
```
## Errors

- [E001] config.json: JSON parse error at line 5
  Fix: Run {{COMMAND_PREFIX}}health --repair to reset to defaults

- [E002] PROJECT.md not found
  Fix: Run {{COMMAND_PREFIX}}new-project to create
```

**If warnings exist:**
```
## Warnings

- [W001] STATE.md references phase 5, but only phases 1-3 exist
  Fix: Run {{COMMAND_PREFIX}}health --repair to regenerate

- [W005] Phase directory "1-setup" doesn't follow NN-name format
  Fix: Rename to match pattern (e.g., 01-setup)
```

**If info exists:**
```
## Info

- [I001] 02-implementation/02-01-PLAN.md has no SUMMARY.md
  Note: May be in progress
```

**Footer (if repairable issues exist and --repair was NOT used):**
```
---
N issues can be auto-repaired. Run: {{COMMAND_PREFIX}}health --repair
```
</step>

<step name="offer_repair">
**If repairable issues exist and --repair was NOT used:**

Ask user if they want to run repairs:

```
Would you like to run {{COMMAND_PREFIX}}health --repair to fix N issues automatically?
```

If yes, re-run with --repair flag and display results.
</step>

<step name="verify_repairs">
**If repairs were performed:**

Re-run health check without --repair to confirm issues are resolved:

```bash
node "$HOME/.claude/gsd-ng/bin/gsd-tools.cjs" validate health
```

Report final status.

| I001 | info | Plan without SUMMARY (may be in progress) | No |
| I002 | info | Phase inventory incomplete because a milestone record is unreadable | No |
| I003 | info | Project-rule graph incomplete because an explicit import is unsafe, unreadable, or beyond a traversal cap | No |
| I010 | info | The resolved CWD, reported alongside E010 | No |

E010 and I010 come from the home-directory guard, which returns before any other check
runs — a report carrying them carries nothing else.

W015 and W016 are named only in comments inside the issue-tracker link check, which
accepts `addIssue` and never calls it, so neither code can be raised today.

W009, W026 and W027 read the Nyquist validation gate and are worth stating plainly:

- **W009** fires on a phase directory holding at least one `-SUMMARY.md` and no `-VALIDATION.md`.
  The summary is the noise guard — keyed on plans alone it would fire on every freshly planned
  phase. The remedy is `{{COMMAND_PREFIX}}validate-phase {N}`, which reconstructs the strategy
  from the phase's own artifacts.
- **W026** resolves every test-file path cited by a verification-map row against `git ls-tree HEAD`,
  not the working directory, and reports the ones that resolve nowhere. A file present only
  locally is not evidence anyone else can check out. Rows that cite no path are not flagged: the
  check punishes false claims, not honest silence.
- **W027** is an **error**, not a warning. A phase whose frontmatter reads `nyquist_compliant: true`
  with no `## Validation Audit` section is making a false statement about release readiness — it
  claims a compliance it has no record of earning. Either re-run validation and earn the flag
  against evidence, or set it back to `false`. The check reads the frontmatter block only, so the
  template's own sign-off checklist line is not mistaken for a promotion, and a phase reading
  `false` *with* an audit trail is the gate working correctly and is never flagged.

<repair_actions>

| Action | Effect | Risk |
|--------|--------|------|
| createConfig | Create config.json with defaults | None |
| resetConfig | Delete + recreate config.json | Loses custom settings |
| regenerateState | Create STATE.md from ROADMAP structure | Loses session history |
| addNyquistKey | Add workflow.nyquist_validation: true to config.json | None — matches existing default |
| writeCLAUDEmd | Create `{{PROJECT_RULES_FILE}}` with Memories section from {{MEMORY_DIR}} | None — generates from existing files |
| syncCLAUDEmdMemories | Update the uniquely revalidated project-rule owner of the Memories section to match {{MEMORY_DIR}} | Replaces only that owner section in-place; refuses incomplete, ambiguous, manual, or changed ownership |
| syncMemoryMd | Regenerate {{MEMORY_DIR}}MEMORY.md from {{MEMORY_DIR}} files | Overwrites MEMORY.md |

**Not repairable (too risky):**
- PROJECT.md, ROADMAP.md content
- Phase directory renaming
- Orphaned plan cleanup
- Topology drift (W014) — complex; suggests running {{COMMAND_PREFIX}}seed-memories manually
