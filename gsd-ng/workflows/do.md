Analyze freeform text from the user and route to the most appropriate GSD command. This is a dispatcher — it never does the work itself. Match user intent to the best command, confirm the routing, and hand off.

<step name="validate">
**Check for input.**

If `$ARGUMENTS` is empty, ask via AskUserQuestion:

```
What would you like to do? Describe the task, bug, or idea and I'll route it to the right GSD command.
```

Wait for response before continuing.
</step>

<step name="check_project">
**Check if project exists.**

```bash
mkdir -p $TMPDIR
node "$HOME/.claude/gsd-ng/bin/gsd-tools.cjs" state load > $TMPDIR/do-state.json 2>/dev/null || true
```

Track whether `.planning/` exists — some routes require it, others don't.
</step>

<step name="route">
**Match intent to command.**

Evaluate `$ARGUMENTS` against these routing rules. Apply the **first matching** rule:

| If the text describes... | Route to | Why |
|--------------------------|----------|-----|
| Starting a new project, "set up", "initialize" | `{{COMMAND_PREFIX}}new-project` | Needs full project initialization |
| Mapping or analyzing an existing codebase | `{{COMMAND_PREFIX}}map-codebase` | Codebase discovery |
| A bug, error, crash, failure, or something broken | `{{COMMAND_PREFIX}}debug` | Needs systematic investigation |
| Exploring, researching, comparing, or "how does X work" | `{{COMMAND_PREFIX}}research-phase` | Domain research before planning |
| Discussing vision, "how should X look", brainstorming | `{{COMMAND_PREFIX}}discuss-phase` | Needs context gathering |
| A complex task: refactoring, migration, multi-file architecture, system redesign | `{{COMMAND_PREFIX}}add-phase` | Needs a full phase with plan/build cycle |
| Planning a specific phase or "plan phase N" | `{{COMMAND_PREFIX}}plan-phase` | Direct planning request |
| Executing a phase or "build phase N", "run phase N" | `{{COMMAND_PREFIX}}execute-phase` | Direct execution request |
| Running all remaining phases automatically | `{{COMMAND_PREFIX}}autonomous` | Full autonomous execution |
| A review or quality concern about existing work | `{{COMMAND_PREFIX}}verify-work` | Needs verification |
| Checking progress, status, "where am I" | `{{COMMAND_PREFIX}}progress` | Status check |
| Resuming work, "pick up where I left off" | `{{COMMAND_PREFIX}}resume-work` | Session restoration |
| A note, idea, or "remember to..." | `{{COMMAND_PREFIX}}add-todo` | Capture for later |
| Adding tests, "write tests", "test coverage" | `{{COMMAND_PREFIX}}add-tests` | Test generation |
| Completing a milestone, shipping, releasing | `{{COMMAND_PREFIX}}complete-milestone` | Milestone lifecycle |
| A specific, actionable, small task (add feature, fix typo, update config) | `{{COMMAND_PREFIX}}quick` | Self-contained, single executor |

**Requires `.planning/` directory:** All routes except `{{COMMAND_PREFIX}}new-project`, `{{COMMAND_PREFIX}}map-codebase`, and `{{COMMAND_PREFIX}}help`. If the project doesn't exist and the route requires it, suggest `{{COMMAND_PREFIX}}new-project` first.

**Ambiguity handling:** If the text could reasonably match multiple routes, ask the user via AskUserQuestion with the top 2-3 options. For example:

```
"Refactor the authentication system" could be:
1. {{COMMAND_PREFIX}}add-phase — Full planning cycle (recommended for multi-file refactors)
2. {{COMMAND_PREFIX}}quick — Quick execution (if scope is small and clear)

Which approach fits better?
```

**Show the routing decision.**

 GSD ► ROUTING
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

**Input:** {first 80 chars of $ARGUMENTS}
**Routing to:** {chosen command}
**Reason:** {one-line explanation}
```
</step>

<step name="dispatch">
**Invoke the chosen command.**

Run the selected `{{COMMAND_PREFIX}}*` command, passing `$ARGUMENTS` as args.

If the chosen command expects a phase number and one wasn't provided in the text, extract it from context or ask via AskUserQuestion.

After invoking the command, stop. The dispatched command handles everything from here.
