/**
 * Collect every requirement ID a phase has actually delivered.
 *
 * Closure must key off delivered work, not declared intent. A PLAN's
 * `requirements:` frontmatter is a statement of what the plan set out to do; the
 * executor may deviate, and a plan may never run at all. The SUMMARY is the
 * record that a plan executed, and its `requirements-completed:` frontmatter is
 * the record of what landed. So each plan is resolved against its own summary:
 *
 *   - no paired summary → the plan has not completed and contributes nothing,
 *     matching how completion is judged everywhere else;
 *   - summary lists IDs → those are the delivered IDs, and any of them the plan
 *     never declared is returned as `undeclared` so the divergence surfaces
 *     instead of being silently accepted;
 *   - summary omits the field entirely → fall back to the plan's declaration.
 *     The field is a comparatively recent addition, so a summary written before
 *     it existed makes no claim either way, and failing closed on silence would
 *     strand every requirement of every phase predating it;
 *   - summary carries the field but empty → close nothing for that plan, and
 *     return it in `emptySummaries`. An empty list is not silence: it is a
 *     written claim to have delivered nothing, and reading a claim of nothing as
 *     permission to close everything inverts it;
 *   - summary unreadable or corrupt → close nothing for that plan, and return it
 *     in `unreadableSummaries`. Falling back here would let a truncated file
 *     close a full declaration, which is the failure this whole mechanism exists
 *     to prevent. An unusable record is not evidence of delivery.
 *
 * The ROADMAP.md phase section's `**Requirements**:` line is a third source and
 * is unioned in, because a phase whose plans carry no `requirements:` would
 * otherwise never close anything — phase-close is the only place closure
 * happens. It is a phase-level declaration, though, not a delivery record, so it
 * is admitted only when the delivery records raise nothing against it: every
 * plan has a summary, none is empty or unreadable, and none records less than
 * its plan declared. Otherwise the phase-level intent would re-close exactly
 * what the per-plan records just withheld.
 *
 * That gate is deliberately all-or-nothing, and must stay that way. The
 * surgical alternative — admit the line and subtract only the IDs some record
 * withheld — looks tighter and is wrong, because it assumes the withheld IDs
 * are exactly the work that did not land. Requirement IDs do not partition work
 * that cleanly: a task an executor dropped can be the work behind a requirement
 * that plan never listed, including one only the roadmap names. So subtracting
 * ID-by-ID closes roadmap-only IDs on the strength of "every plan ran", which
 * is precisely the inference the narrowing disproved. The two failure modes are
 * not symmetric — over-closing asserts in the traceability table that unshipped
 * work is done and nobody is told, while under-closing leaves an ID Pending and
 * reports why in `narrowedSummaries`, which a re-run clears once the narrowing
 * is resolved. Fail closed, and report.
 *

 * Check off the requirement IDs this phase is entitled to close in

 * attributes to a phase that has not run. Closing it there would make the table
 * assert that unstarted work is done, which is exactly the lie the table exists
 * to prevent. Each candidate therefore falls into one of four cases:
 *
 *   - the table gives it a row for this phase → close the row and tick the box;
 *   - that row is Blocked → change nothing and return it as blocked. A block is
 *     a human decision closure must not revert, and that applies to the checkbox
 *     and to `closed` no less than to the row itself;
 *   - that row's status is not one this code knows → change nothing and return
 *     it as unreadable. A word nobody can interpret is not permission to close;
 *     the safe reading of an unknown state is that it is not done;
 *   - the table gives it a row for some other phase → change nothing, and
 *     return it so the caller can report it. Skipping silently would strand the
 *     requirement: the declaring phase thinks it shipped it, the owning phase
 *     may never run, and nobody is told;
 *   - the table has no row for it at all → nothing can contradict the plan, so
 *     tick the box, and return it as unmapped. This is the case that keeps a
 *     project with no traceability table working.
