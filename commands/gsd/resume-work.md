<objective>
Restore complete project context and resume work seamlessly from previous session.

Routes to the resume-project workflow which handles:

- STATE.md loading (or reconstruction if missing)
- Checkpoint detection (.continue-here files)
- Incomplete work detection (PLAN without SUMMARY)
- Status presentation
- Context-aware next action routing
  </objective>

</execution_context>

<tool_usage>
CRITICAL: You MUST use the AskUserQuestion tool for ALL user choices in this workflow. NEVER output plain-text menus, lettered lists (a/b/c), or numbered option lists. Every decision point requires a real AskUserQuestion tool call with the questions parameter.

The AskUserQuestion tool schema:
```json
{
  "questions": [
    {
      "question": "The question text",
      "header": "Short label (max 12 chars)",
      "multiSelect": false,
      "options": [
        { "label": "Option label", "description": "What this option means" }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

Key constraints:
- header: max 12 characters (abbreviate if needed)
- options: 2-4 items; "Other" is added automatically by the tool — do NOT add it yourself
- multiSelect: true for "select all that apply", false for "pick one"
- If user picks "Other" (free text): follow up as plain text, not another AskUserQuestion
</tool_usage>

<process>
**Follow the resume-project workflow** from `@~/.claude/get-shit-done/workflows/resume-project.md`.

The workflow handles all resumption logic including:

1. Project existence verification
2. STATE.md loading or reconstruction
3. Checkpoint and incomplete work detection
4. Visual status presentation
5. Context-aware option offering (checks CONTEXT.md before suggesting plan vs discuss)
6. Routing to appropriate next command
7. Session continuity updates
   </process>
