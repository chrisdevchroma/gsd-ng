<objective>
Execute all plans in a phase using wave-based parallel execution.

Orchestrator stays lean: discover plans, analyze dependencies, group into waves, spawn subagents, collect results. Each subagent loads the full execute-plan context and handles its own plan.

Context budget: ~15% orchestrator, 100% fresh per subagent.

<context>
Phase: $ARGUMENTS

**Flags:**
- `--gaps-only` — Execute only gap closure plans (plans with `gap_closure: true` in frontmatter). Use after verify-work creates fix plans.

Context files are resolved inside the workflow via `gsd-tools init execute-phase` and per-subagent `<files_to_read>` blocks.

<tool_usage>
CRITICAL: You MUST use the AskUserQuestion tool for ALL user choices in this workflow. NEVER output plain-text menus, lettered lists (a/b/c), or numbered option lists. Every decision point requires a real AskUserQuestion tool call with the questions parameter.

The AskUserQuestion tool schema:
```json
{
  "questions": [
    {
      "question": "The question text",
      "header": "Short label (max 12 chars)",
      "multiSelect": false,
      "options": [
        { "label": "Option label", "description": "What this option means" }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

Key constraints:
- header: max 12 characters (abbreviate if needed)
- options: 2-4 items; "Other" is added automatically by the tool — do NOT add it yourself
- multiSelect: true for "select all that apply", false for "pick one"
- If user picks "Other" (free text): follow up as plain text, not another AskUserQuestion
</tool_usage>

<process>
Execute the execute-phase workflow from @~/.claude/gsd-ng/workflows/execute-phase.md end-to-end.
Preserve all workflow gates (wave execution, checkpoint handling, verification, state updates, routing).
</process>
