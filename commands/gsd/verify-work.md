<objective>
Validate built features through conversational testing with persistent state.

Purpose: Confirm what Claude built actually works from user's perspective. One test at a time, plain text responses, no interrogation. When issues are found, automatically diagnose, plan fixes, and prepare for execution.

Output: {phase_num}-UAT.md tracking all test results. If issues found: diagnosed gaps, verified fix plans ready for {{COMMAND_PREFIX}}execute-phase
</objective>

<tool_usage>
CRITICAL: You MUST use the {{USER_QUESTION_TOOL}} tool for ALL user choices in this workflow. NEVER output plain-text menus, lettered lists (a/b/c), or numbered option lists. Every decision point requires a real {{USER_QUESTION_TOOL}} tool call with the questions parameter.

The {{USER_QUESTION_TOOL}} tool schema:
```json
{
  "questions": [
    {
      "question": "The question text",
      "header": "Short label (max 12 chars)",
      "multiSelect": false,
      "options": [
        { "label": "Option label", "description": "What this option means" }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

Key constraints:
- header: max 12 characters (abbreviate if needed)
- options: 2-4 items; "Other" is added automatically by the tool — do NOT add it yourself
- multiSelect: true for "select all that apply", false for "pick one"
- If user picks "Other" (free text): follow up as plain text, not another {{USER_QUESTION_TOOL}}
</tool_usage>

</execution_context>

<context>
Phase: $ARGUMENTS (optional)
- If provided: Test specific phase (e.g., "4")
- If not provided: Check for active sessions or prompt for phase

Context files are resolved inside the workflow (`init verify-work`) and delegated via `<files_to_read>` blocks.
</context>

<process>
Execute the verify-work workflow from @~/.claude/gsd-ng/workflows/verify-work.md end-to-end.
Preserve all workflow gates (session management, test presentation, diagnosis, fix planning, routing).
