<objective>
Audit Nyquist validation coverage for a completed phase. Three states:
- (A) VALIDATION.md exists — audit and fill gaps
- (B) No VALIDATION.md, SUMMARY.md exists — reconstruct from artifacts
- (C) Phase not executed — exit with guidance

Output: updated VALIDATION.md + generated test files.
</objective>

<tool_usage>
CRITICAL: You MUST use the AskUserQuestion tool for ALL user choices in this workflow. NEVER output plain-text menus, lettered lists (a/b/c), or numbered option lists. Every decision point requires a real AskUserQuestion tool call with the questions parameter.

The AskUserQuestion tool schema:
```json
{
  "questions": [
    {
      "question": "The question text",
      "header": "Short label (max 12 chars)",
      "multiSelect": false,
      "options": [
        { "label": "Option label", "description": "What this option means" }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

Key constraints:
- header: max 12 characters (abbreviate if needed)
- options: 2-4 items; "Other" is added automatically by the tool — do NOT add it yourself
- multiSelect: true for "select all that apply", false for "pick one"
- If user picks "Other" (free text): follow up as plain text, not another AskUserQuestion
