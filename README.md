# GET SHIT DONE NG

**gsd-ng is a next-generation hard fork of GSD, optimized for Claude Code and GitHub Copilot CLI.**

Forked from [gsd-build/get-shit-done](https://github.com/gsd-build/get-shit-done).

**A light-weight and powerful meta-prompting, context engineering and spec-driven development system.**

**Solves context rot — the quality degradation that happens as Claude fills its context window.**

---

Vibecoding has a bad reputation. You describe what you want, AI generates code, and you get inconsistent garbage that falls apart at scale.

GSD fixes that. It's the context engineering layer that makes Claude Code reliable. Describe your idea, let the system extract everything it needs to know, and let Claude Code get to work.

---

## Who This Is For

People who want to describe what they want and have it built correctly — without pretending they're running a 50-person engineering org.

---

## Getting Started

```bash
npx gsd-ng@latest
```

The installer prompts you to choose your install location (global or local project).

Verify with:
- Claude Code: `/gsd:help`
- Copilot CLI: `gsd-help` (skills format)

### Staying Updated

GSD evolves fast. Update periodically:

```bash
npx gsd-ng@latest
```

<details>
<summary><strong>Non-interactive Install (Docker, CI, Scripts)</strong></summary>

```bash
npx gsd-ng --runtime claude --global    # Install to ~/.claude/
npx gsd-ng --runtime claude --local     # Install to ./.claude/
npx gsd-ng --runtime copilot --local    # Install for Copilot CLI to ./.github/
npx gsd-ng --runtime copilot --global   # Install for Copilot CLI to ~/.copilot/
```

Use `--runtime claude` or `--runtime copilot` with `--global` (`-g`) or `--local` (`-l`) to skip the interactive prompts.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Development / Building from Source</strong></summary>

Use this when working on a development branch or testing local changes.

**1. Clone and checkout branch:**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/chrisdevchroma/gsd-ng.git
cd gsd-ng
git checkout <branch-name>
```

**2. Install dependencies:**

```bash
npm install
```

This installs dev dependencies (esbuild, c8) needed for building and testing.

**3. Build hooks:**

```bash
npm run build:hooks
```

Copies hook scripts to `hooks/dist/`. The installer expects built hooks in `hooks/dist/`, so this step is required before installing.

**4. Install locally into your project:**

Run from inside the target project directory (not the gsd-ng clone):

```bash
node bin/install.js --runtime claude --local
node bin/install.js --runtime copilot --local   # For Copilot CLI
```

Installs to `./.claude/` (or `./.github/` for Copilot).

**5. Run tests:**

```bash
npm test
```

**6. Run tests with coverage:**

```bash
npm run test:coverage
```

</details>

### Sandbox Mode

Sandbox mode is configured automatically during install. The installer seeds `settings.json` with sandbox settings and pre-approved permissions for all GSD operations.

To opt out during install, use `--no-seed-sandbox-config`.

> [!TIP]
> If GSD ever triggers an approval dialog in sandbox mode, that's a bug -- [open an issue](https://github.com/chrisdevchroma/gsd-ng/issues).

<details>
<summary><strong>Alternative: Skip Permissions Mode</strong></summary>

If you prefer to skip all permission checks:

```bash
claude --dangerously-skip-permissions
```

This disables all safety checks. Sandbox mode (above) is preferred because it provides the same frictionless experience while maintaining filesystem isolation.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Alternative: Custom Granular Permissions</strong></summary>

If you want to customize which commands are allowed, add this to your project's `.claude/settings.json`:

```json
{
  "permissions": {
    "allow": [
      "Bash(date *)",
      "Bash(git *)",
      "Bash(node *)",
      "Bash(npm *)"
    ]
  }
}
```

See `gsd-ng/gsd-ng/templates/settings-sandbox.json` for the complete list of GSD-required commands.

</details>

## How It Works

> **Already have code?** Run `/gsd:map-codebase` first. It spawns parallel agents to analyze your stack, architecture, conventions, and concerns. Then `/gsd:new-project` knows your codebase — questions focus on what you're adding, and planning automatically loads your patterns.

### 1. Initialize Project

```
/gsd:new-project
```

One command, one flow. The system:

1. **Questions** — Asks until it understands your idea completely (goals, constraints, tech preferences, edge cases)
2. **Research** — Spawns parallel agents to investigate the domain (optional but recommended)
3. **Requirements** — Extracts what's v1, v2, and out of scope
4. **Roadmap** — Creates phases mapped to requirements

You approve the roadmap. Now you're ready to build.

**Creates:** `PROJECT.md`, `REQUIREMENTS.md`, `ROADMAP.md`, `STATE.md`, `.planning/research/`

---

### 2. Discuss Phase

```
/gsd:discuss-phase 1
```

**This is where you shape the implementation.**

Your roadmap has a sentence or two per phase. That's not enough context to build something the way *you* imagine it. This step captures your preferences before anything gets researched or planned.

The system analyzes the phase and identifies gray areas based on what's being built:

- **Visual features** → Layout, density, interactions, empty states
- **APIs/CLIs** → Response format, flags, error handling, verbosity
- **Content systems** → Structure, tone, depth, flow
- **Organization tasks** → Grouping criteria, naming, duplicates, exceptions

For each area you select, it asks until you're satisfied. The output — `CONTEXT.md` — feeds directly into the next two steps:

1. **Researcher reads it** — Knows what patterns to investigate ("user wants card layout" → research card component libraries)
2. **Planner reads it** — Knows what decisions are locked ("infinite scroll decided" → plan includes scroll handling)

The deeper you go here, the more the system builds what you actually want. Skip it and you get reasonable defaults. Use it and you get *your* vision.

**Creates:** `{phase_num}-CONTEXT.md`

---

### 3. Plan Phase

```
/gsd:plan-phase 1
```

The system:

1. **Researches** — Investigates how to implement this phase, guided by your CONTEXT.md decisions
2. **Plans** — Creates 2-3 atomic task plans with XML structure
3. **Verifies** — Checks plans against requirements, loops until they pass

Each plan is small enough to execute in a fresh context window. No degradation, no "I'll be more concise now."

**Creates:** `{phase_num}-RESEARCH.md`, `{phase_num}-{N}-PLAN.md`

---

### 4. Execute Phase

```
/gsd:execute-phase 1
```

The system:

1. **Runs plans in waves** — Parallel where possible, sequential when dependent
2. **Fresh context per plan** — 200k tokens purely for implementation, zero accumulated garbage
3. **Commits per task** — Every task gets its own atomic commit
4. **Verifies against goals** — Checks the codebase delivers what the phase promised

Walk away, come back to completed work with clean git history.

**How Wave Execution Works:**

Plans are grouped into "waves" based on dependencies. Within each wave, plans run in parallel. Waves run sequentially.

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  PHASE EXECUTION                                                    │
├─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│                                                                     │
│  WAVE 1 (parallel)          WAVE 2 (parallel)          WAVE 3       │
│  ┌─────────┐ ┌─────────┐    ┌─────────┐ ┌─────────┐    ┌─────────┐  │
│  │ Plan 01 │ │ Plan 02 │ →  │ Plan 03 │ │ Plan 04 │ →  │ Plan 05 │  │
│  │         │ │         │    │         │ │         │    │         │  │
│  │ User    │ │ Product │    │ Orders  │ │ Cart    │    │ Checkout│  │

│  └─────────┘ └─────────┘    └─────────┘ └─────────┘    └─────────┘  │
│       │           │              ↑           ↑              ↑       │
│       └───────────┴──────────────┴───────────┘              │       │
│              Dependencies: Plan 03 needs Plan 01            │       │
│                          Plan 04 needs Plan 02              │       │
│                          Plan 05 needs Plans 03 + 04        │       │
│                                                                     │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Why waves matter:**
- Independent plans → Same wave → Run in parallel
- Dependent plans → Later wave → Wait for dependencies
- File conflicts → Sequential plans or same plan

This is why "vertical slices" (Plan 01: User feature end-to-end) parallelize better than "horizontal layers" (Plan 01: All models, Plan 02: All APIs).

**Creates:** `{phase_num}-{N}-SUMMARY.md`, `{phase_num}-VERIFICATION.md`

---

### 5. Verify Work

```
/gsd:verify-work 1
```

**This is where you confirm it actually works.**

Automated verification checks that code exists and tests pass. But does the feature *work* the way you expected? This is your chance to use it.

The system:

1. **Extracts testable deliverables** — What you should be able to do now
2. **Walks you through one at a time** — "Can you log in with email?" Yes/no, or describe what's wrong
3. **Diagnoses failures automatically** — Spawns debug agents to find root causes
4. **Creates verified fix plans** — Ready for immediate re-execution

If everything passes, you move on. If something's broken, you don't manually debug — you just run `/gsd:execute-phase` again with the fix plans it created.

**Creates:** `{phase_num}-UAT.md`, fix plans if issues found

---

### 6. Repeat → Complete → Next Milestone

```
/gsd:discuss-phase 2
/gsd:plan-phase 2
/gsd:execute-phase 2
/gsd:verify-work 2
...
/gsd:complete-milestone
/gsd:new-milestone
```

Loop **discuss → plan → execute → verify** until milestone complete.

If you want faster intake during discussion, use `/gsd:discuss-phase <n> --batch` to answer a small grouped set of questions at once instead of one-by-one.

Each phase gets your input (discuss), proper research (plan), clean execution (execute), and human verification (verify). Context stays fresh. Quality stays high.

When all phases are done, `/gsd:complete-milestone` archives the milestone and tags the release.

Then `/gsd:new-milestone` starts the next version — same flow as `new-project` but for your existing codebase. You describe what you want to build next, the system researches the domain, you scope requirements, and it creates a fresh roadmap. Each milestone is a clean cycle: define → build → ship.

---

### Quick Mode

```
/gsd:quick
```

**For ad-hoc tasks that don't need full planning.**

Quick mode gives you GSD guarantees (atomic commits, state tracking) with a faster path:

- **Same agents** — Planner + executor, same quality
- **Skips optional steps** — No research, no plan checker, no verifier by default
- **Separate tracking** — Lives in `.planning/quick/`, not phases

**`--discuss` flag:** Lightweight discussion to surface gray areas before planning.

**`--research` flag:** Spawns a focused researcher before planning. Investigates implementation approaches, library options, and pitfalls. Use when you're unsure how to approach a task.

**`--verify` flag:** Enables plan-checking (max 2 iterations) and post-execution verification.

**`--all` flag:** Enables all optional stages (discuss + research + verify).

Flags are composable: `--discuss --research --verify` gives discussion + research + plan-checking + verification.

**Quick Mode Flags**

| Flag | What it adds |
|------|-------------|
| `--discuss` | Lightweight discussion phase, captures decisions in CONTEXT.md |
| `--research` | Spawns research agent, produces RESEARCH.md |
| `--verify` | Plan-checking (max 2 iterations) + post-execution verification |
| `--all` | All of the above (discuss + research + verify) |

```
/gsd:quick
> What do you want to do? "Add dark mode toggle to settings"
```

**Creates:** `.planning/quick/001-add-dark-mode-toggle/PLAN.md`, `SUMMARY.md`

---

## Why It Works

### Context Engineering

Claude Code is powerful — but without structured context, results degrade as projects grow. Context gets lost, quality drops, and code stops fitting together.

GSD handles context for you:

| File | What it does |
|------|--------------|
| `PROJECT.md` | Project vision, always loaded |
| `research/` | Ecosystem knowledge (stack, features, architecture, pitfalls) |
| `REQUIREMENTS.md` | Scoped v1/v2 requirements with phase traceability |
| `ROADMAP.md` | Where you're going, what's done |
| `STATE.md` | Decisions, blockers, position — memory across sessions |
| `PLAN.md` | Atomic task with XML structure, verification steps |
| `SUMMARY.md` | What happened, what changed, committed to history |
| `todos/` | Captured ideas and tasks for later work |

### XML Prompt Formatting

Every plan is structured XML optimized for Claude:

```xml
<task type="auto">
  <name>Create login endpoint</name>
  <files>src/app/api/auth/login/route.ts</files>
  <action>
    Use jose for JWT (not jsonwebtoken - CommonJS issues).
    Validate credentials against users table.
    Return httpOnly cookie on success.
  </action>
  <verify>curl -X POST localhost:3000/api/auth/login returns 200 + Set-Cookie</verify>
  <done>Valid credentials return cookie, invalid return 401</done>
</task>
```

### Multi-Agent Orchestration

Every stage uses the same pattern: a thin orchestrator spawns specialized agents, collects results, and routes to the next step.

| Stage | Orchestrator does | Agents do |
|-------|------------------|-----------|
| Research | Coordinates, presents findings | 4 parallel researchers investigate stack, features, architecture, pitfalls |
| Planning | Validates, manages iteration | Planner creates plans, checker verifies, loop until pass |
| Execution | Groups into waves, tracks progress | Executors implement in parallel, each with fresh 200k context |
| Verification | Presents results, routes next | Verifier checks codebase against goals, debuggers diagnose failures |

The orchestrator never does heavy lifting. It spawns agents, waits, integrates results.

**The result:** You can run an entire phase — deep research, multiple plans created and verified, thousands of lines of code written across parallel executors, automated verification against goals — and your main context window stays at 30-40%. The work happens in fresh subagent contexts. Your session stays fast and responsive.

### Atomic Git Commits

Each task gets its own commit immediately after completion:

```bash
abc123f docs(08-02): complete user registration plan
def456g feat(08-02): add email confirmation flow
hij789k feat(08-02): implement password hashing
lmn012o feat(08-02): create registration endpoint
```

> [!NOTE]
> **Benefits:** Git bisect finds exact failing task. Each task independently revertable. Clear history for Claude in future sessions. Better observability in AI-automated workflow.

### Modular by Design

- Add phases to current milestone
- Insert urgent work between phases
- Complete milestones and start fresh
- Adjust plans without rebuilding everything

You're never locked in. The system adapts.

## Configuration

GSD stores project settings in `.planning/config.json`. Configure during `/gsd:new-project` or update later with `/gsd:settings`. For the full config schema, workflow toggles, git branching options, and per-agent model breakdown, see the [User Guide](docs/USER-GUIDE.md#configuration-reference).

### Core Settings

| Setting | Options | Default | What it controls |
|---------|---------|---------|------------------|
| `mode` | `yolo`, `interactive` | `interactive` | Auto-approve vs confirm at each step |
| `granularity` | `coarse`, `standard`, `fine` | `standard` | Phase granularity — how finely scope is sliced (phases × plans) |

### Model Profiles

Control which Claude model each agent uses. Balance quality vs token spend.

| Profile | Planning | Execution | Verification |
|---------|----------|-----------|--------------|
| `quality` | Opus | Opus | Sonnet |
| `balanced` (default) | Opus | Sonnet | Sonnet |
| `budget` | Sonnet | Sonnet | Haiku |

Switch profiles:
```
/gsd:set-profile budget
```

Or configure via `/gsd:settings`.

### Workflow Agents

These spawn additional agents during planning/execution. They improve quality but add tokens and time.

| Setting | Default | What it does |
|---------|---------|--------------|
| `workflow.research` | `true` | Researches domain before planning each phase |
| `workflow.plan_check` | `true` | Verifies plans achieve phase goals before execution |
| `workflow.verifier` | `true` | Confirms must-haves were delivered after execution |
| `workflow.auto_advance` | `false` | Auto-chain discuss → plan → execute without stopping |

Use `/gsd:settings` to toggle these, or override per-invocation:
- `/gsd:plan-phase --skip-research`
- `/gsd:plan-phase --skip-verify`

### Execution

| Setting | Default | What it controls |
|---------|---------|------------------|
| `parallelization.enabled` | `true` | Run independent plans simultaneously |
| `planning.commit_docs` | `true` | Track `.planning/` in git |

### Git Branching

Control how GSD handles branches during execution.

| Setting | Options | Default | What it does |
|---------|---------|---------|--------------|
| `git.branching_strategy` | `none`, `phase`, `milestone` | `none` | Branch creation strategy |
| `git.phase_branch_template` | string | `gsd/phase-{phase}-{slug}` | Template for phase branches |
| `git.milestone_branch_template` | string | `gsd/{milestone}-{slug}` | Template for milestone branches |

**Strategies:**
- **`none`** — Commits to current branch (default GSD behavior)
- **`phase`** — Creates a branch per phase, merges at phase completion
- **`milestone`** — Creates one branch for entire milestone, merges at completion

At milestone completion, GSD offers squash merge (recommended) or merge with history.

---

## Security

### Protecting Sensitive Files

GSD's installer automatically seeds a `permissions.deny` list in `settings.json` that blocks access to sensitive files (`.env`, `.pem`, `.key`, credentials, `.aws/`, `.ssh/`, `.npmrc`, and more).

To see the full deny list, inspect `gsd-ng/gsd-ng/templates/settings-sandbox.json`.

To add custom deny patterns, edit your project's `.claude/settings.json`:

```json
{
  "permissions": {
    "deny": [
      "Read(.env)",
      "Read(**/*.pem)",
      "Read(**/.ssh/*)"
    ]
  }
}
```

> [!IMPORTANT]
> GSD's sandbox deny list prevents Claude from reading sensitive files, reducing the risk of secrets appearing in generated code. For additional protection, consider a pre-commit hook like [git-secrets](https://github.com/awslabs/git-secrets) or [detect-secrets](https://github.com/Yelp/detect-secrets).

> [!NOTE]
> **Linux users:** The sandbox template uses bare `Edit`, `Write`, and `Read` permissions (without glob patterns) because Linux's bubblewrap sandbox ignores gitignore-style globs in these rules. See [#16170](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code/issues/16170) and [#6881](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code/issues/6881).

---

## Troubleshooting

**Commands not found after install?**
- Restart your runtime to reload commands/skills
- Verify files exist in `~/.claude/commands/gsd/` (global) or `./.claude/commands/gsd/` (local)

**Commands not working as expected?**
- Run `/gsd:help` to verify installation
- Re-run `npx gsd-ng` to reinstall

**Updating to the latest version?**
```bash
npx gsd-ng@latest
```

**Using Docker or containerized environments?**

If file reads fail with tilde paths (`~/.claude/...`), set `CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR` before installing:
```bash
CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR=/home/youruser/.claude npx gsd-ng --runtime claude --global
```
This ensures absolute paths are used instead of `~` which may not expand correctly in containers.

### Uninstalling

To remove GSD completely:

```bash
# Claude Code - global installs
npx gsd-ng --runtime claude --global --uninstall

# Claude Code - local installs (current project)
npx gsd-ng --runtime claude --local --uninstall

# Copilot CLI - local installs
npx gsd-ng --runtime copilot --local --uninstall

# Copilot CLI - global installs
npx gsd-ng --runtime copilot --global --uninstall
```

This removes all GSD commands/skills, agents, hooks, and settings while preserving your other configurations.
